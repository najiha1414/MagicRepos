# Etiqa Virtual Induction Programme

This is my project I made during industrial training at Etiqa Insurance company (Sept 2021 - Feb 2022) to implement the theory knowledge of Unity and C# language into practise.

The project is exclusively for both Etiqa's permanent and new employees to participate and try out the virtual induction programme developed using Unity game engine software.

The project is in WebGL format and has published into UnityPlay website for everyone to use easier.
